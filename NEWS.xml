    <subject>News Section!</subject>
    <text>In order to do a better job of announcing changes in the game,
      I've added a "News" section which will be displayed during
      login.  It should only display news that you haven't seen yet,
      and you can use "Q" to quit out of the news display early.

      If you want to see the news items at any point once in the
      game, use the NEWS command.</text>
